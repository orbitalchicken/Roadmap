New bug reports in Linux Mint 19.1 BETA

All editions
------------

mintdriver:
	After a standard install, I ran Driver Manager and chose to change from the default nouveau driver to the nvidia-590 driver. Rebooted and all good.
    I then switched back to the nouveau driver, and rebooted.
    When I now go into Driver Manager, it says I have manually installed a driver and it will not allow me to select either the nouveau or nvidia-590 driver.

ubiquity:
	GRUB TIME OUT isn't set properly

Cinnamon Edition
----------------

in HiDPI, keyboard applet, the flags is not the proper size. Hovering it fixes it.

wacom buttons ignored in tablet mode

gwl:
	different system settings modules (say colors and date-time) get grouped together, despite having a different icon

menu:
	With the modern layout, the Menu icon (the Mint logo) looks blurry compared to the “crisp” icons of the grouped applications taskbar
	I would like a tiny bit more space between the start menu and the following "Grouped windows list" icons, like with "panel launcher" or "window list" that have a bit space to their left.

Fixed in Git:
	xed menu item not translated
