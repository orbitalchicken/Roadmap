New bug reports in Linux Mint 18.3 BETA

All editions
------------
	compatibility mode in EFI?

	mintinstall
		some flatpaks are missing icons
		if you use the tab key to move between the Featured application, Editors’ Picks and Categories, you can find yourself in a position where you have one from each selected category simultaneously – so you can’t hit the Enter key. There are in all likelihood shortcut keys for the Software Manager that i’m unaware of, but just saying this isn’t great. Related to this, when i try to install a package, i have to use my mouse – is that correct, i can’t seem to be able to select Install by tabbing over to it or selecting CTRL+I.

	mintsources:
		search for ubuntu mirror -> freeze/crash

	mintupdate:
		no window progress when installing/removing kernel
		check window size in 1024x768 with panel
