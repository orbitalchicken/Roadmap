Not a bug
---------
    Software Manager: remove a package with dependencies, Software Manager continues to show the dependencies as installed. -> we only rebuild
    startup apps: 1) install Caffeine or any other software that will appear in Startup Applications, 2) uninstall it, 3) Open Startup Application and the link is still there -> need to apt purge since it's a conf file
